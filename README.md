Ever since India banned apps made by Chinese developers such as TikTok on June 29 2020, many Indian users started using domestic alternatives such as MX TakaTak, Moj and Josh. This timeframe coincides with a sudden boost in traffic to a seemingly ordinary photo of a purple daisy hosted by Wikimedia Commons - in fact the photo itself has received around 78 million hits each day.

After further investigation it turns out there is a correlation between these two events - one of these apps have 'hot linked' the flower photo, which is when a website displays an image by linking to the original site where it's hosted, instead of uploading it separately. The flower photo itself does not seem to appear anywhere in the apps themselves, so it turns out this is a case of sloppy coding where a developer might have copied and pasted code and was remiss in deleting the image source code before pushing it to production.
